## Etch-A-Sketch - The Odin Project Assignment (Foundations)

This project involves creating an Etch-A-Sketch webpage. The aim of this is to build on the HTML, CSS and Javascript covered so far in The Odin Project's foundations curriculum.

There has been some further investigation required to find the best to solve this problem. This includes:
*CSS grid
*HTML input attributes
\*JS "mouseover" event
